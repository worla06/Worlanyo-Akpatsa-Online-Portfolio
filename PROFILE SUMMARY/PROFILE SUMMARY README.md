I’m Worlanyo Akpatsa, a passionate and motivated IT professional with a strong foundation in cloud computing, Microsoft 365 administration, Azure infrastructure, Windows Server environments, and networking. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from the University of Toronto and have completed hands-on projects across Microsoft 365, Azure, and Windows Server, simulating real enterprise environments.

From deploying virtual machines and configuring domain controllers in Windows Server Core, to managing Exchange Online, SharePoint, Teams, and implementing security policies in Microsoft 365 — I bring both technical ability and problem-solving skills to every project I work on.

I’m currently seeking internship, co-op, or entry-level opportunities in IT infrastructure, cloud support, or systems administration — where I can contribute value, learn continuously, and grow with a forward-thinking team.
