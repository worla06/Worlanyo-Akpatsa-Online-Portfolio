Project Summary

To simulate a real-world IT administrator role, I completed tasks that involved setting up collaboration platforms, managing app policies, and enforcing endpoint protection configurations. These tasks were designed to provide hands-on experience in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and Microsoft Intune environment.

What I Did

1. SharePoint Online Site Management
    •    Accessed the SharePoint Admin Center and created a new site for a dedicated project team.
    •    Configured key site settings, including user permissions and external sharing restrictions, to ensure secure collaboration.
    •    Verified successful site creation by granting access to selected users and confirming their ability to collaborate on documents and content.

2. Microsoft 365 Application Administration
    •    Identified five common application types used with Windows devices, such as Win32, UWP, and MSIX.
    •    Listed five app types associated with Android devices, including APKs and Managed Google Play apps.
    •    Determined which device types are compatible with app protection policies (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows 10/11).
    •    Learned that app configuration policies can be applied to managed apps, devices, and user groups.
    •    Reviewed all built-in app categories in Intune such as Productivity, Collaboration, and Security.

3. OneDrive for Business Management
    •    Accessed the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and configured OneDrive settings for an individual user account, including storage quotas and sharing permissions.
    •    Synchronized the user’s OneDrive library with a local machine and verified file sync functionality.
    •    Confirmed successful syncing by accessing files both online and offline.

4. Endpoint Security and Intune Administration
    •    Reviewed the available security baselines in Microsoft Intune, including:
    •    Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
    •    Microsoft Edge Security Baseline
    •    Windows 10/11 Security Baseline
    •    Identified the three types of anti-virus policies available for Windows 11 devices in Intune:
    •    Microsoft Defender Antivirus
    •    Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
    •    Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)
    •    Determined that the disk encryption policy for macOS devices is called FileVault in Microsoft Intune.
