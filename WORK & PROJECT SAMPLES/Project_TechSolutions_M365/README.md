Microsoft 365 Enterprise Deployment – TechSolutions Inc. Case Study

This comprehensive project simulated the deployment and management of a Microsoft 365 environment for a fictional mid-sized company, TechSolutions Inc., which has approximately 300 employees. The goal was to implement a full Microsoft 365 setup focusing on user management, collaboration tools, compliance, security, and monitoring to support company-wide digital transformation.

Project Summary

As part of this simulation, I took on the role of a Microsoft 365 administrator, managing the setup and ongoing administration of an enterprise-level cloud environment. The project was designed to mirror real-world IT operations, incorporating bulk user provisioning, Microsoft Defender configuration, SharePoint/Teams setup, and robust compliance monitoring.
